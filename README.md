# 2D-Steganography-
The project implements the 2D Steganography technique in Java.

A data (in the form of text) can be hidden in an image and this encoded image can be decoded later to get back the orginal text that was hidden in the image. The project basically highlights the working of data hiding through images.


The Steganography_Controller class contains the main function and imports and runs all the other three classes.
